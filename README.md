# Personal Blog using Flask

This is a basic and small template of a personal blog that is made using Flask.


## Requirements:
 - Python 3.9.1
 - Flask 2.0.2

Assuming you already have python and pip installed:

> `python -m pip install flask`


**Remember**: Running this in Flask is only done in development environment. Never use flask environment in production. It is not secure and unsuitable for such.


To run this in Flask, enter the following commands:
 - Windows CMD
   + set FLASK_APP=blog.py
   + set FLASK_ENV=development
   + flask run
 - Linux Terminal
   + export FLASK_APP=blog.py
   + export FLASK_ENV=development
   + flask run


> **P.S.: DO NOT put spaces before and after the '=' in the above commands.**


The final result of the index page looks like this.
